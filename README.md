Yo dudes, I be the @TheLegendaryKizo, workin' towards a goal of extraordinary heights! While I do spend most my time playin' games, I find my self in loads of entertainment while programmin'-
And speakin' of programming, I know my way around most mainstream languages, as well as more niche tools like Google Scripts.
Oh, and feel free to use whatever pronouns you feel most confortable reffering to me as, I got no preference.

Wanna talk? Look no further, I got you covered: thelegendarykizo@gmail.com
NOTE: I may be a little late to respond to emails, and there's definetly the chance that'll get auto-filtered as spam. If I don't get back to you in a week, try contacting my other socials.
